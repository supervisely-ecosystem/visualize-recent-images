<!-- _This section is about how to use the repo template,
FIXME: it should be removed from README.md after the app is ready to be released._<br>

### How to use the repo template

1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Use the `create_venv.sh` script to create a virtual environment and install all required packages.
3. Fill required fields in the `local.env` file (your IDs: team, workspace, etc.).
4. Code in `src/*.py` files are ready-to-use examples of how to use Supervisely Python SDK.
You can use them as a reference or replace with your own code.
7. After implementing all required code and UI, fill in `config.json` file. If needed edit `dev_requirements.txt` file.
8. The repo is ready now.
